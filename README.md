# In Search of the Horizon


## The Inspiration
Horizons has been spitting out successful Horizonites for several years now. Some ended up in random cities, but most exist as clusters in cities such as SF, NYC, Seattle, etc. Because connections are arguably one of the most valuable ROI's of the program, it is important to keep tabs on fellow Horizonites- especially ones nearby. In Search of the Horizon makes certain each Horizonite is aware of the Horizon community that surrounds them every single day.
